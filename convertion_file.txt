A second perspective focuses on the social processes that can make social media especially risky for adolescents who are already vulnerable. UNICEF explains that many young people depend on likes as a public form of approval, which can increase sensitivity to exclusion and make feelings of loneliness stronger when online interaction replaces face toface contact UNICEF. The same report highlights cyberbullying, where embarrassing photos or hurtful messages can spread instantly and have been linked to low selfesteem and, in severe situations, suicide UNICEF. The PMC review adds that peerrelated risks, such as cyber victimisation, exposure to selfharm content and constant comparison with idealised images, are all connected with higher levels of depressive symptoms PMC. It also notes that using phones late at night often leads to shorter sleep and daytime tiredness, both known risk factors for later mental health problems PMC. Taken together, this evidence suggests that it is not social media itself but certain patterns of use and specific negative experiences that may pose the greatest threats to adolescents wellbeing.
However, the same sources show that social media can also provide psychological and social benefits when used in a balanced way. UNICEF states that moderate use to stay in contact with friends and family can strengthen existing offline relationships UNICEF. According to the World Health Organization, even heavy but nonproblematic users often report stronger feelings of peer support and social connection, and many adolescents describe social media as a place to meet others who share their interests World Health Organization. The PMC review identifies further advantages, such as access to health information and online spaces where young people can receive mental health support PMC. At the same time, the review points out important research limitations: many studies rely on selfreported screen time and treat different online activities as the same, which makes the results less precise and may hide important individual differences PMC. Overall, the evidence suggests that the effects of social media depend strongly on why adolescents use it, how they use it, and the social contexts in which their use takes place.
Overall, the findings from UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the PMC review point to a balanced understanding of social medias impact on adolescent mental health. Problematic patterns of use, such as compulsive scrolling, latenight phone use and exposure to cyberbullying or selfharm content, are linked to higher risks of depression, anxiety and disrupted sleep. At the same time, moderate and purposeful engagement can strengthen relationships, provide social support and offer access to helpful information. Because the existing research often relies on selfreported data and groups different online activities together, the evidence is not fully precise, and digital platforms continue to change quickly. As a result, the findings do not support either extreme worry or complete optimism. Instead, they highlight the need for healthier online habits, stronger digital literacy and safer platform design, while future research works to identify which specific patterns of social media use matter most for young peoples mental health.
